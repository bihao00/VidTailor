# VidTailor
**An Adaptive Video-Based Personalized Learning System**

VidTailor is an intelligent learning support system for video-based education.  
It leverages **user behavioral signals, error patterns, and collaborative interaction**
to deliver personalized practice, structured knowledge review, and timestamp-based peer learning.

---

## 🎯 Project Motivation

Video-based learning platforms often suffer from **passive consumption**, fragmented review,
and limited peer interaction.  
VidTailor addresses these challenges by introducing **behavior-driven adaptivity**
and **system-level learning support** beyond static video playback.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Behavior-Driven Personalization
- Extracts user interaction signals (e.g., rewatch frequency, pause density)
- Identifies key knowledge points and learning difficulties
- Generates adaptive practice questions and personalized learning paths

### 2. Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge Structuring
- Integrates mistake logs, annotatable notes, and knowledge graphs
- Maps learning content to video timestamps for precise recall
- Enables systematic interdisciplinary review

### 3. Timestamp-Based Collaborative Learning
- Supports real-time, timestamp-linked discussions on video content
- Connects learners with similar difficulties via smart group chat
- Enhances motivation and peer interaction efficiency
